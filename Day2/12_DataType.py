#We can use the len() function to get the number of characters in a string.
#Example:

print(len("Hello"))

# Primitive Data Types in Python:
# String, Integer, Float, and Boolean.

#Primitive Data Type: Strings
print("Hello"[0])

# First character of the word "Hello", putting 0 inside the square brackets.
# Printing this gives capital H, because it is the first character of the string.
# Always start counting from zero. The first character or element is always at index 0.

# Subscripting
print("Hello"[1])


# Susbscripting last character, "o".
print("Hello"[4])

# Subscripting last character "o". Using the other form of -(number index):
print("Hello"[-1])
#Give us the same result as before.

# Staring from the end, going to the beginning.
print("Hello"[-3])
