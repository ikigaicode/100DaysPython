# If I want a line of text to not be considered by the computer at all,
# all I have to do is add the hashtag sign #
# or pound sign
# in front of the text.
# and this turns it into a comment.

# Like this. Yes, THIS text. line 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7.

#Something the computer will completely ignore. And I can write code even, as much as I like, but it won't be executed.

# This way I will write notes for myself to explain to me what I was doing.
# And hopefully help with my memory and make it much easier to comprehend what's going on.
