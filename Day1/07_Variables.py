# Lesson about Python variables.

# name is the variable then I will be able to refer to it later. This assigns whatever the user typed in as input to a variable called name.
name = input("What is your name?")
print(name)

#Then another way of writing a variable.

name = "Joshua"
print(name)

# Now I give another name to the variable name,

name = "Artemis"
print(name)
