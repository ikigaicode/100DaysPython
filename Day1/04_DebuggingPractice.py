#Fix the code below.

print("Notes from Day 1")
print("The print statement is used to output strings")
print("Strings are strings of characters")
print("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")


# While this line is correct:
#print("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")

#While running the code, it shows an error:
#SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\ ' print("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")

#I search such error on Google, and I came to learn that:

#Escape the Backslash: To include a literal backslash in a regular string, escape it by using a double backslash (\\).
#Python:
# print("This is a backslash: \\")

print("New lines can be created with a \\ and the letter n")
