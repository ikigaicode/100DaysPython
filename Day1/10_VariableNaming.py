#Learning the rules of variable naming in Python.

name = "Artemis"
lenght = len(name)
print(lenght)

#Also, we can changed the variable names as:

n = "Alvaro"
l = len(n)
print(l)

#But is not recommended, because when someone need to check the code, it will be difficult to understand what it is doing.
# So, we must be more explicit with variables' names.

# Rule 1: make the code readable.
