# Writing the code below this line.

print("Hello Terra!\nHello Terra!\nHello Terra!")


# Learning to use -String concatenation-

print("Hello" + "Artemis")

# we notice that both strings are printed as one single word. There is no space between both words.

#We need to add a -space character-between both words.

#There are tree option we can apply:
#The first one is adding a space in the string "Hello", before the end quotation mark of the first string.

print("Hello " + "Artemis")

# The second option is adding a space at the beginning of the second string "Artemis", before the letter A.

print("Hello" + " Artemis")

# The third option is adding a -space string-, between the last two. Using concatenation. As follows:

print("Hello" + " " + "Artemis")
